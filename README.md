| About | PAC Man OOP Game is a python game that incorporate Object-oriented programming principles to create classes to create characters and coins to create a game.                                                                                   |

├── pacman.py            # Pacman class that inherits from parent
├── ghost.py             # Ghost class that inherits from parent
├── coin.py              # Coin class that is passed into other classes to increase coin levels.
├── main.py              # Main File that runs the game

## Features
- Each character (both ghosts and Pacmans) have the ability to move on a grid using (x,y) coordinates
- Each character has an eat method where if they bummp into one another, the character with the highest coin level eats the other character.
- Ghosts are given a color attribute and a mood for visual effects.
- Each character is able to add or lose coins based on class methods.
- Ghosts have a visibility method that changes there visibility on the board for visual effects.


## Learnings
- created classes
- used single-class inheritance
- used a super method to inherit attributes from parent classes
- generated a random amount of coins for each characters

## Improvements for the game
- Using Pygame library to draw character and the grid
- Creating buttons to start and pause the game
